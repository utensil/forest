# Agent Instructions for Forest

*Last updated 2025-01-06*

> **purpose** ‚Äì This file is the onboarding manual for every AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) and every human who edits this repository.  
> It encodes our coding standards, guard-rails, and workflow tricks so the *human 30 %* (architecture, tests, domain judgment) stays in human hands.

## 0. Project overview

Forest is a sophisticated mathematical research environment and Zettelkasten system built using Forester. It serves as a personal knowledge management system for mathematical concepts, technical experiments, and research notes, with over 1300+ commits accumulated since 2024.

The system combines multiple technologies to create a hybrid authoring environment that supports both web-based browsing and traditional academic PDF generation. It integrates Forester (a Zettelkasten note-taking system) with modern development tools, mathematical typesetting, and experimental interactive content.

**Golden rule**: When unsure about implementation details or requirements, ALWAYS consult the developer rather than making assumptions.

---

## 1. Non-negotiable golden rules

### G-0: Always ask for clarification when unsure
- ‚úÖ **May**: Ask the developer for clarification before making changes when unsure about project-specific details
- ‚ùå **Must NOT**: Write changes or use tools when uncertain about something project-specific or lacking context for a particular feature/decision

### G-1: Stay within designated code areas  
- ‚úÖ **May**: Generate code only inside relevant source directories (`bun/`, `trees/`, `tex/`, `assets/`) or explicitly pointed files
- ‚ùå **Must NOT**: Touch test files, CI configs, or core build scripts without explicit permission

### G-2: Use anchor comments appropriately
- ‚úÖ **May**: Add/update `FOREST-NOTE:` anchor comments near non-trivial edited code
- ‚ùå **Must NOT**: Delete or mangle existing `FOREST-*` comments

### G-3: Follow project linting and style
- ‚úÖ **May**: Follow lint/style configs (`biome.json`, `knip.json`) using the configured linter (Biome)
- ‚ùå **Must NOT**: Re-format code to any other style

### G-4: Get approval for large changes
- ‚úÖ **May**: Make changes, but ask for confirmation if >300 LOC or >3 files
- ‚ùå **Must NOT**: Refactor large modules without human guidance

### G-5: Maintain task context boundaries
- ‚úÖ **May**: Stay within current task context, inform dev if fresh start would be better
- ‚ùå **Must NOT**: Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" ‚Äì start a fresh session

---

## 2. Build, test & utility commands

Use `just` tasks for consistency (they ensure correct environment variables and configuration).

```bash
# Development and building
just dev             # Development server with file watching at http://localhost:1314
just build           # Main build command that builds Forest + bun assets
just forest          # Build the forest using forester
just chk             # Biome linting/formatting (--fix in dev, ci mode in CI)

# Single file builds
just js bun/<file>   # Build single JS/TS file
just css bun/<file>  # Build single CSS file

# LaTeX and PDF generation
./lize.sh <tree-id>  # Build LaTeX documents to PDF
just lize            # Build multiple LaTeX documents

# Content management
just new <prefix>    # Create new tree file
just rss-stars       # Process RSS starred items into learning diary
```

For simple, quick checks: `bunx biome check --fix` (ensure correct CWD).

---

## 3. Coding standards

*   **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ES2022+, Bun runtime, `async/await` preferred.
*   **Formatting**: Biome enforces 4-space indents, single quotes, semicolons as needed. Standard Biome linter rules.
*   **Typing**: Enabled where beneficial; focus on maintainability over strict typing.
*   **Naming**: `camelCase` (JS/TS functions/variables), `PascalCase` (components), `kebab-case` (files), `SCREAMING_SNAKE` (constants).
*   **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation; log errors with context.
*   **Documentation**: JSDoc for complex functions; inline comments for complex logic.
*   **Dependencies**: Check `knip.json` for unused dependency detection.

**Error handling patterns**:
- Use try/catch blocks appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Gracefully handle missing dependencies (especially WASM modules)

Example:
```javascript
// FOREST-NOTE: WASM modules may fail to load; graceful degradation required
try {
    const wasmModule = await import('./lib/egglog/pkg/egglog.js')
    return wasmModule.processData(input)
} catch (error) {
    console.warn('WASM module unavailable, falling back to simple processing:', error)
    return simpleProcessing(input)
}
```

- **Interactive Components**: WASM-based computational tools

---

## 5. Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for. 

### Guidelines:

- Use `FOREST-NOTE:`, `FOREST-TODO:`, or `FOREST-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- Keep them concise (‚â§ 120 chars).
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `FOREST-*` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove `FOREST-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  * too long, or
  * too complex, or
  * very important, or
  * confusing, or
  * could have a bug unrelated to the task you are currently working on.

Example:
```javascript
// FOREST-NOTE: perf-hot-path; WASM loading can be slow on first run
async function loadEgglogWasm() {
    ...
}
```

---

## 6. Commit discipline

*   **Granular commits**: One logical change per commit.
*   **Tag AI-generated commits**: e.g., `feat: optimize shader loading [AI]`.
*   **Clear commit messages**: Explain the *why*; link to issues if architectural.
*   **Use conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, etc.
*   **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand.

---

## 7. üå≤ Forester content & tree files

*   To modify tree content, **edit `.tree` files** in `trees/`.
*   **Follow Forester syntax**: Use `\import{macros}`, `\taxon{type}`, `\tag{topic}` for organization.
*   **Mathematical content**: Use `\refcardt{type}{name}{tag}{ref}{}` for theorems, definitions, etc.
*   **Address format**: Use `xxx-NNNN` where `xxx` is prefix (uts, ag, tt, ca, spin, hopf) and `NNNN` is base-36 number.
*   **Content structure**: Wrap paragraphs in `\p{}`, use proper mathematical notation.

**Tree file pattern example**:
```forester
\import{macros}
\taxon{definition}
\tag{category-theory}

\title{Category Definition}

\p{A \strong{category} #{C} consists of:}

\ol{
  \li{A collection of objects #{\Ob(C)}}
  \li{A collection of morphisms #{\Mor(C)}}
  \li{Composition operation...}
}

\refcardt{definition}{category}{category-theory}{maclane1971}{
  \p{Formal definition of a category...}
}
```

---

## 8. üå≤ Learning Diary & RSS Integration

*   Learning diary entries use `\mdblock{YYYY-MM-DD}{}` format.
*   Process RSS starred items: `just rss-stars` generates JSON data for integration.
*   Entries are sorted by arrival date (newest first).
*   Use consistent link formats: `[Title](URL)` for web resources, `\citek{ref-id}` for citations.
*   Group related items under topic headers when multiple entries exist.

**Learning diary example**:
```forester
\mdblock{2025-01-06}{
- Math
    - found [Category Theory Illustrated](https://example.com/ct-illustrated)
    - read \citek{maclane1971categories}
- ML
    - found [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
}
```

## 9. üå≤ Build system & dependencies

*   **Bun**: Primary JavaScript/TypeScript runtime and package manager.
*   **Biome**: Linting and formatting (configured in `biome.json`).
*   **Lightning CSS**: CSS processing and bundling.
*   **Forester**: Tree file processing and site generation.
*   **WASM modules**: Custom modules cloned to `lib/` directory, built with `wasm-pack`.
*   **LaTeX**: PDF generation using custom templates in `tex/`.

**Build process**:
1. `just dev` starts development server with file watching
2. Changes to `.tree` files trigger Forester rebuild
3. Changes to `bun/` files trigger JavaScript/CSS rebuilding
4. WASM modules are built in CI or when `UTS_DEV` environment variable is set

---

## 10. üå≤ Mathematical notation & macros

*   **Inline math**: `#{math expression}`
*   **Display math**: `##{math expression}`
*   **Equations**: `\eqtag{id}{equation}` for numbered equations
*   **Category theory**: Use predefined macros for common symbols (`\Cat`, `\Set`, `\Mor`, etc.)
*   **String diagrams**: Use category theory macro system for building diagrams
*   **TikZ diagrams**: `\tikzfig{}` blocks for complex mathematical diagrams

**Mathematical content guidelines**:
- Import `macros.tree` at the start of mathematical files
- Use `\refcardt{}` for formal mathematical statements
- Include proofs in `\proof{}` blocks
- Use proper mathematical typography and spacing

---

## 11. Common pitfalls

*   Forgetting to import `macros.tree` in new tree files.
*   Using incorrect Forester syntax (missing `\p{}` around paragraphs).
*   Not following tree file naming conventions (xxx-NNNN format).
*   Mixing different quotation styles in JavaScript (use single quotes).
*   Not handling WASM module loading failures gracefully.
*   Editing generated files instead of source files.
*   Large refactors without considering build dependencies.

---

## 12. üå≤ Domain-Specific Terminology

*   **Tree**: A single note file in Forester format (`.tree` extension).
*   **Forest**: The collection of all trees and their interconnections.
*   **Taxon**: Document type classification (`definition`, `theorem`, `lemma`, etc.).
*   **Tag**: Topic classification for organizing content by subject area.
*   **Address**: Unique identifier for tree files (format: `prefix-NNNN`).
*   **Transclusion**: Including content from one tree within another.
*   **Macro**: Reusable Forester commands and mathematical notation.
*   **WASM**: WebAssembly modules for computational features (egglog, wgputoy, etc.).
*   **Learning Diary**: Time-based entries documenting research and learning progress.
*   **Just**: Task runner used for build commands and development workflows.
*   **Biome**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting and formatting tool.
*   **Lightning CSS**: CSS processing and bundling tool.

---

## 14. üå≤ Testing framework & validation

*   **No formal testing framework**: This project focuses on mathematical content and documentation.
*   **Validation approaches**: Build verification, link checking, LaTeX compilation.
*   **Content validation**: Ensure tree files have proper Forester syntax.
*   **Manual testing**: Preview changes in development server before committing.

**Validation commands**:
```bash
just chk            # Lint JavaScript/TypeScript files
just forest         # Validate Forester syntax and build
just build          # Full build validation
```

---

## 15. Directory-Specific documentation

*   **Always check existing patterns** in directories before adding new content.
*   **Follow naming conventions** established in each subject area (uts, ag, tt, ca, spin, hopf).
*   **Mathematical topics** should follow academic conventions and cite sources properly.
*   **Update macro files** when introducing new notation or symbols.

**Subject-specific guidelines**:
- **uts**: General mathematical notes and learning diary
- **ag**: Algebraic geometry concepts and constructions  
- **tt**: Type theory and categorical logic
- **ca**: Category theory fundamentals
- **spin**: Clifford algebras and spin groups
- **hopf**: Hopf algebras and quantum groups

---

## 16. Versioning & deployment

*   **No formal versioning**: Content-focused repository with continuous integration.
*   **Deployment**: Automatic GitHub Pages deployment on main branch push.
*   **Git workflow**: Direct commits to main for content, feature branches for major changes.
*   **Backup strategy**: Git history serves as version control and backup.

---

## 17. Performance considerations

*   **WASM loading**: First-time WASM module loading can be slow; implement graceful degradation.
*   **Build optimization**: Use file watching in development to avoid full rebuilds.
*   **Asset optimization**: Lightning CSS and Bun handle minification and bundling.
*   **PDF generation**: LaTeX compilation is resource-intensive; run only when needed.

**Performance patterns**:
```javascript
// FOREST-NOTE: Cache WASM modules to avoid repeated loading
let wasmCache = new Map();

async function loadWasmModule(name) {
    if (wasmCache.has(name)) {
        return wasmCache.get(name);
    }
    
    try {
        const module = await import(`./lib/${name}/pkg/${name}.js`);
        wasmCache.set(name, module);
        return module;
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`WASM module ${name} unavailable:`, error);
        return null;
    }
}
```
