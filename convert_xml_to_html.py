XML to HTML Incremental Build Script
===================================

This script incrementally converts XML files in the output/ directory to HTML using XSLT (output/uts-forest.xsl).
It is designed to be idempotent, robust, and fast, supporting parallel execution and accurate dependency checking.

Key Features:
- Only rebuilds HTML files if the corresponding XML or the XSL file is newer, or if the HTML is missing.
- Uses Python's concurrent.futures for parallelism, maximizing CPU utilization while avoiding overload.
- Reports progress and the number of files actually updated.
- Handles errors gracefully, printing clear error messages but continuing the build.
- Designed for integration with build systems (e.g., mise, just) and for deterministic, reproducible builds.

Usage:
    uv run convert_xml_to_html.py

Extension Points:
- To support additional output formats or XSLT parameters, extend the convert_one() function.
- To change the input/output directories, modify OUTPUT_DIR and XSL_PATH.
- For CLI options, add argument parsing to main().

AGENT-NOTE: CRITICAL FEATURES TO MAINTAIN
1. IDEMPOTENT: Multiple runs must produce identical results
2. ERROR HANDLING: Graceful degradation for missing data
3. BUILD INTEGRATION: Validates syntax after processing
4. DETERMINISTIC: Sorted processing ensures consistent output
