## Description

The current rss2linkwarden script lacks visibility into progress when processing large datasets. With --days 24 there are too many links and the script hangs without clear progress indication. Need better batch progress reporting archiving status and dry-run capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add entry count display before processing starts
- [ ] Add dry-run mode to preview what would be imported
- [ ] Enhanced progress bar showing batch progress and rate limiting pauses
- [ ] Detailed archiving wait status with timeout indicators
- [ ] Background execution support with periodic progress checks
- [ ] Graceful termination handling for long-running imports
- [ ] Clear indication when rate limiting pauses occur
- [ ] Archive polling shows actual wait times and success/failure status

## Implementation Plan

1. Add entry count display before processing starts
2. Implement dry-run mode to preview imports without API calls
3. Enhanced progress bar with batch information and rate limiting visibility
4. Detailed archiving wait status with timeout and error indicators
5. Add dataset size warnings and time estimates
6. Test background execution approaches
7. Implement graceful termination handling
8. Add clear progress indicators for all waiting states

## Implementation Notes

## Approach Taken
- Enhanced progress reporting with comprehensive batch and timing information
- Implemented dry-run mode for safe preview of large datasets
- Added detailed archiving status with error handling and timeout management
- Fixed duplicate detection to handle both HTTP 400 and 409 responses
- Tested robustness with multiple import runs

## Features Implemented
- Entry count display before processing (Found 6 entries from 2579 total RSS entries)
- Dry-run mode with --dry-run flag (no API token required)
- Enhanced progress bar with batch numbers (Batch 1/2, Batch 2/2)
- Rate limiting visibility (Rate limiting pause 5s)
- Detailed archiving status with timing (Archiving link 212 (1/15, 0.0s))
- Clear success/failure indicators with emojis (✅❌⚠️)
- Dataset size warnings and time estimates for large imports
- Proper duplicate detection for HTTP 409 responses

## Technical Decisions
- Used tqdm progress bar with custom descriptions for real-time status
- Implemented separate archive polling function with progress integration
- Added emoji indicators for better visual feedback
- Fixed duplicate detection to handle Linkwarden's HTTP 409 responses
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Modified Files
- linkwarden_import.py: Complete enhancement of progress reporting and duplicate handling

## Test Results
- Successfully tested with 6 entries showing detailed progress
- Dry-run mode tested with 183 entries (14 days) showing 11.2 minute estimate
- Duplicate detection working: properly categorizes duplicates vs failures
- Multiple runs show robust handling: duplicates: 2, failed: 0, created: 4
- Archive polling shows clear status even with HTTP 401 auth issues
