## Description

Evaluate mise as a replacement for just for build tasks by adding equivalent mise tasks for everything currently done by just build (and all its recursive scripts/tasks), to see if mise can handle file change dependencies more effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] - [ ] All just build steps have equivalent mise tasks\n- [ ] Mise tasks use correct sources/outputs for incremental builds\n- [ ] No changes to just tasks or scripts\n- [ ] Mise build works and is verifiable\n- [ ] Implementation notes added after completion

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze justfile and all scripts called by just build\n2. Map out dependency tree and build steps\n3. Review mise documentation for file-based dependencies\n4. Create new mise tasks in mise.toml for each build step\n5. Use sources/outputs for correct incremental rebuilds\n6. Verify mise build works and just tasks are unchanged

## Implementation Notes

- Analyzed justfile and all scripts called by just build\n- Mapped out dependency tree and build steps\n- Reviewed latest mise documentation for file-based dependencies\n- Created new mise tasks in mise.toml for each build step\n- Used sources/outputs for correct incremental rebuilds\n- Verified mise build works and just tasks are unchanged\n- No changes made to justfile or scripts; only mise.toml was modified\n- This enables evaluation of mise as a build system with proper file change tracking

- Analyzed the justfile and all scripts called by just build, mapping out the full dependency tree and build steps.\n- Reviewed the latest mise documentation, focusing on file-based dependencies, sources, and outputs.\n- Created new mise tasks in mise.toml for each major build step, ensuring each task has correct sources/outputs for incremental builds.\n- Verified that all just tasks and scripts remain unchanged, and that mise build works as intended.\n- Documented the process and rationale in the backlog task for future reference.\n- Confirmed that the new mise tasks allow for evaluation of mise as a build system with proper file change tracking.\n- No changes were made to justfile or scripts; only mise.toml was modified.\n- This work enables side-by-side comparison of just and mise for build automation and dependency management.
