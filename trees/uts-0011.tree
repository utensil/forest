\note{initial survey on writing Rust in Forester}{
\md{
I wish to be able to call rust libraries that are WASM compatible to use it for both BSR and SSR.

Here is my initial survey:

- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/commands/build.html) and [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) are the two main tools for building and binding rust to javascript, more info see [awesome-rust-and-webassembly](https://github.com/rustwasm/awesome-rust-and-webassembly)
- I wish to write one-file Rust and specify the dependencies in the file, [rust-script](https://github.com/fornwall/rust-script) is similar in spirit but it's for server-side execution.
- I wish to find prior art on doing this with bun, found [bun-ffi-rust](https://github.com/jotoh98/bun-ffi-rust) and [hyperimport](https://github.com/tr1ckydev/hyperimport), but again, it's for server-side execution.
}
