\title{Motivation}

\p{This survey is built on my notes in the process of figuring out [[ericwieser]]'s MathOverflow question [Definition of a spin group](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/427881/definition-of-a-spin-group) for [our PR to Mathlib4 about Spin groups](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9111/).}

\p{This is also my first [[uts-0001]].}
