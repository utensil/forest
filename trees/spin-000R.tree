\title{Motivation}

\p{This survey is built on my notes in the process of figuring out [[ericwieser]]'s MathOverflow question [Definition of a spin group](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/427881/definition-of-a-spin-group) for [our PR](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9111/) to Lean 4's Mathlib about Spin groups.}

\p{This is my first [[math-000S]], also a spiritual successor to my writeup [The Many Faces of Geometric Algebra](https://github.com/pygae/lean-ga/blob/master/docs/misc/many_faces.md).}
