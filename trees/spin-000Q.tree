The Pin group \(\operatorname{Pin}(V ; q)\) of a quadratic vector space, is the subgroup of the group of units in the Clifford algebra \(\mathrm{Cl}(V, q)\)

The Spin group \(\operatorname{Spin}(V, q)\) is the further subgroup of \(\operatorname{Pin}(V ; q)\) on those elements which are even number multiples \(v_1 \cdots v_{2 k}\) of elements \(v_i \in V\) with \(q\left(v_i\right)=1\).
