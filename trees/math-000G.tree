\note{some links for rendering implicit surfaces}{
  \ul{
    \li{\citek{singh2009real} has reviews on related work, an algorithm and many examples. But it has no code.
    }
    \li{[SURFER](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/SURFER) renders implicit surfaces using ray-tracing, the result is stunning well. It also has a Java library with [many examples](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/jsurf/tree/master/examples).
    }
    \li{[Raycasting Implicit Surfaces](https://cindyjs.org/gallery/main/Raytracer/) based on [CindyJS](https://cindyjs.org/) is Web-based implicit surface renderer using ray-tracing, and the source code is best suited for reproducing and learning. It also has a rich set of examples.
    }
    \li{[Raycasting a surface of degree 4](https://cindyjs.org/examples/cindygl/36_raycasting_kummer.html) is a relatively simpler example of ray-tracing implicit surfaces with source [here](https://github.com/CindyJS/CindyJS/blob/main/examples/cindygl/36_raycasting_kummer.html).
    }
    \li{[mla](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/mla) has a series of shaders from simple to complicated to render the Kummer surface, see [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/results?query=Kummer). mla has also ported a tiny ray tracer [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsjGRW) which could be a starting point.
    }
    \li{A simpler but more versatile ray-tracer for implicit surfaces is [Implicit surfaces created by Rogolop](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/l3BSRG).
