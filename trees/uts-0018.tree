        - In the bytecode, which is tersely encoded, jumps are offsets, some control-flow is implicit, and most dataflow is via the stack.
        - By contrast, HIR looks more like a graph. Jumps have pointers to their targets and there’s no stack: instructions that use data have pointers directly to the instructions that create the data.
