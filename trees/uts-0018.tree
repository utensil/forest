- \citek{hamilton2023supergeometric} and \citek{hamilton2023unification}: illuminating path towards a unified theory of four fundamental forces, the first theory seemingly capable of reaching the same level of elegance and simplicity as \citek{wilson2024discrete}, the authors are also aware of potential issues and worked out viable solutions to address them. Unfortunately, there are no citations as of now.
  - \citek{trautman1997clifford} has certain historical remarks and a unusual approach that spinor representations are treated first for odd-dimensional spaces
