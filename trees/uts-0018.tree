        - TPC-C is a benchmark for transactional databases that models an order system with goods spanning many warehouses
        - Each warehouse comes with some set amount of data to be managed and some amount of query traffic that adheres to some specific distribution laid out in the spec
            - they can account for
                - what's the proportion of hot vs. cold data
                - what's the ratio of transactions-per-minute to bytes stored
                - what's the proportion of read-only queries, vs. simple, point writes, vs. complex read-write transactions
                - what proportion of transactions go cross-shard
        - The metric: "we sustained the workload at X warehouses with Y hardware at Z cost."

        - context
            - modern LLMs just need direct detailed context, no tricks, but clarity and lack of contradictions
            - structuring context so that the system part is large and static and user one is small and dynamic works great
            - provide the bare minimum of knowledge in the first place, and the option to fetch more context if needed via tools
            - [context compaction](https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/blob/2a09b4e0c4ba1d7ddba04832514352f424852a04/agent/core/actors.py#L241) tools can help avoiding logs and other artifacts from the feedback loop to bloat the context
        - tools
            - good tools typically operate on a similar level of granularity, and have a limited number of strictly typed parameters
            - idempotency is highly recommended to avoid state management issues
            - LLMs are very likely to misuse your loopholes, and that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt want to have any loopholes
                - v.s. human API users are more capable of reading between the lines, can navigate complex docs and find workarounds
            - designing an agent to write some DSL (domain-specific language) code with actions rather than calling tools one by one is a great idea
        - feedback loop
            - actor-critic approach: where an actor decides on actions and a critic evaluates them
                - allow actors to be creative, and critics to be strict
            - error recovery
                - a chain of bad fixes is not fixable anymore - just discard and try again
            - agents try alternatives because the explicitly requested tool call failed with crucial ingredients
                - tell them to ask for these ingredients before trying alternatives
            - baseline agent + logs + LLM analysis = insights for improvments
    - [Q&A: Combining Math and LLMs](https://justinmath.com/combining-math-and-llms/)
        - Raw math/algos and LLM are both powerful tools in your modeling toolkit

        - some quotes:
            - Alignment and safety for LLMs (should) mean that we should be able to quantify and bound the probability with which certain undesirable sequences are generated
            - Human thought is a poorly-understood process, involving enormously many neurons, extremely high-bandwidth input, an extremely complicated cocktail of hormones, constant monitoring of energy levels, and millions of years of harsh selection pressure
            - Navigating the dramatic changes of the next few decades while trying to avoid world wars and murderous ideologies is difficult enough without muddying our thinking.

            - objectivity
                - Fairy Tale (aka Wishful Thinking): A shallow justification is given, for instance only pros but no cons
                - Sales Pitch: exaggerations and bragging
                - Free Lunch Coupon (aka Candy Bar): consequences are ignored accidentally or hidden deliberately
                - Dummy Alternative: made up options to make the preferred option shine and give the impression that multiple alternatives have been evaluated
            - time
                - Sprint (aka Rush): only one option is considered; only short-term effects are discussed
                - Tunnel Vision: only a local, isolated context is considered, e.g. developmental qualities are covered, but the consequences for operations and maintenance
                - Maze: the discussion derails and centers on details that are not relevant in the given context
            - record size and content nature

    - Particle theory lacks experimental input, relying on "hot topics" under oligarchs, now facing funding collapse.
