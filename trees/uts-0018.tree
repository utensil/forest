- trying to figure out curvature calculation in shaders
  - [Screen Space Curvature Shader](https://madebyevan.com/shaders/curvature/) is a trick to mimic curvature calculation in shaders,using [dFdx, dFdy in GLSL](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/dFdx.xhtml), [Curvature shader by iY0Yi](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsGXzc) used it but it shows certain shower door effect
  - [glsl-autodiff](https://github.com/sibaku/glsl-autodiff) properly uses forward auto differentiation to calculate curvature in shaders, but it requires rewrite every math function for bookkeeping the gradient and the Hessian
