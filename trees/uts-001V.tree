\mdnote{Matrix}{
The Matrix Cookbook (November 15, 2012) \citek{petersen2008matrix} covers many useful results about matrices, and Eric Wieser's project [lean-matrix-cookbook](https://github.com/eric-wieser/lean-matrix-cookbook) aims to give one-liner proofs (with reference to the counter part in Mathlib) to all of them.

The project is far from complete and it would be great to claim a small portion of interested results and contribute to it. I also wish to figure out the GA counterpart of the same portion.

Previous interests about matrices rise from Steven De Keninck's work on GALM \citek{de2019geometric}, since the paper I have been interested in GA approaches that has practical advantages over traditional matrix-based methods. Notably the paper also discussed the link between degenerate Clifford algebras and dual numbers / automatic differentiation. A more recent inspiration might be his new work [LookMaNoMatrices](https://github.com/enkimute/LookMaNoMatrices).

TODO: decide which results are interesting and feasible to be formalized for me.

I wish to pursue further on the topic of Matrix/Tensor, see \citek{taylor2024introduction} and \citek{randy2023matrix}. The former also led me to [Einsums in C++](https://github.com/Einsums/Einsums). For the latter, I'm thinking of [HepLean.SpaceTime.CliffordAlgebra](https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean/blob/master/HepLean/SpaceTime/CliffordAlgebra.lean).
