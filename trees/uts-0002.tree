\title{Forester experiment}

\date{2024-04-27}

\p{I'm experimenting using Jon Sterling's [Forester](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml) for building [forests of evergreen notes](https://www.jonmsterling.com/tfmt-000V.xml) like his [Notes on duploid theory](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-0047.xml).}

\p{I wish to use it to organize many definitions, proofs and discussions about the same mathematical concepts/topics. This is a spiritual successor to my [The Many Faces of Geometric Algebra](https://github.com/pygae/lean-ga/blob/master/docs/misc/many_faces.md) writeup.}

\p{My hope is to find these notes easier to reuse and refer to in blogs, papers, blueprints etc.}

\p{See [The Forester markup language](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-007N.xml) for Markup references, also consult [Forester changlog](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml) for updates.}

\p{To search, press \code{Ctrl+K} or \code{Cmd+K}.}

\p{The math in this forest are mostly rendered as SVG images, to copy texts you need to open the SVG image in a new browser tab then select them.}

\p{To find the source of a page including the LaTeX, head over [my forest repository](https://github.com/utensil/forest) and use "Go to file" to search for the "note ID" that looks like e.g. "spin-0001".}
