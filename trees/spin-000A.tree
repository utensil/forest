\texdef{Spin group}{weber2013lie}{
The ``group of units" in $C l_{p, q}$, denoted $C l_{p, q}^{\times}$, is the group of all invertible elements. 

An important subgroup of $C l^{\times}(V, q)$ is the group $P(V, q)$ generated by elements $v \in V$ with $q(v) \neq 0$. Quotienting out by constants, we obtain the Pin group. Specifically, $\operatorname{Pin}(V, q)$ (or $\operatorname{Pin}_{p, q}$ ) is the group generated by elements $v \in V$ with $q(v)= \pm 1$. Further define the spin groups to be
$$
\operatorname{Spin}(V, q)=\operatorname{Pin}(V, q) \cap C l^0(V, q) .
