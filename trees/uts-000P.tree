Here we only list some graphs worth adapting:

## pgfplots

- [Heteroskedasticity in a model of linear regression](https://pgfplots.net/heteroskedasticity-linear-regression/)
- [Spiral cone with projections and annotations](https://pgfplots.net/spiral-cone/)
- [Plotting several 2d functions in a 3d graph](https://pgfplots.net/2d-functions-in-3d/)
- [Lorentz system](https://pgfplots.net/lorentz-system/) (requires LuaLaTeX)
- [Moebius strip](https://pgfplots.net/moebius-strip/) (requires non-DVI drivers)

## TikZ

- [Izaak Neutelings](https://tikz.net/author/izaak/) has diagrams covering all areas of Physics, e.g. [vector analysis on manifolds](https://tikz.net/dynamics_moment_of_inertia_parrallel_axis/), [3D coordinate systems](https://tikz.net/axis3d/), [diagrams on different planes](https://tikz.net/decay_planes/)
- [Analysis](https://tikz.net/category/mathematics/analysis/) has many diagrams on analysis.
- [Bernouilliâ€™s equation](https://tikz.net/fluid_dynamics_bernouilli/) has diagrams with proper shading of complicated smooth geometries.
- Some other interesting diagrams: [Helicoid](https://tikz.net/helicoid/), [Manifold mapping](https://tikz.net/manifold/), [topology](https://tikz.net/closed-string-topologies/), [Convolution Operator](https://tikz.net/conv2d/), [Fourier series & synthesis with projections](https://tikz.net/fourier_series/), [Tree with aligned matrix](https://tikz.net/tree-matrix/)
