I've long wished to note down memorable quotes from Star Trek. Particularly the Discovery, Picard, Orville and Strange New Worlds series in recent years.

I have tried to look for high quality transcripts of these series, and selected quotes.

Here are some good resources:

- OpenSubtitles.org has subtitles organized by episode and season, e.g. [Star Trek: Discovery (2017)](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/ssearch/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-537065) but there is no easy way to bulk download and review the quality of the subtitles. Many subtitles from various sources are provided for each episode, and good subtitles might not be available for all episodes e.g. [filtering by the title and the uploader](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/ssearch/sublanguageid-all/uploader-goldenbeard/idmovie-537065)
- Memory Alpha on Fandom has detailed articles on each episode, with "Summary" for the plot and "Memorable quotes"
    - e.g. [Star Trek: Discovery](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery)
    - full list of [TV and films](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:TV_and_films)
- a few websites from China:
    - https://www.startrekchina.org/ (also [on Github](https://github.com/narwhrl/narwhrl.github.io))
    - https://docs.startrekcn.cn/ (also [on Github](https://github.com/narwhrl/stcn-docs))
- [Star Trek TrueType Font Collection](https://github.com/wrstone/fonts-startrek)
}
