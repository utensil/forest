A [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra) is a #{Z_2}-[graded algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_algebra), and a [Filtered algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtered_algebra), the associated graded algebra is the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra).

It may be thought of as quantizations (cf. quantum group) of the exterior algebra, in the same way that the Weyl algebra is a quantization of the symmetric algebra. [Specifically](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Clifford+algebra#AsQuantizedExteriorAlgebra), for #{V} an inner product space, the symbol map constitutes an isomorphism of the underlying super vector spaces of the Clifford algebra with the exterior algebra on  #{V}, and one may understand the Clifford algebra as the quantization Grassmann algebra induced from the inner product regarded as an odd [symplectic form](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/symplectic+form).

Weyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a [*-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*-algebra), and can be unified as even and odd terms of a [superalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalgebra), as discussed in [CCR and CAR algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR_and_CAR_algebras).

A [Clifford module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_module) is a representation of a Clifford algebra.

A [Generalized Clifford algebra (GCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Clifford_algebra) can also refer to associative algebras that are constructed using forms of higher degree instead of quadratic forms, e.g.

> For #{q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_m \in \mathbb{k}^*}, the generalized Clifford algebra #{C^{(n)}\left(q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_m\right)} is a unital associative algebra generated by #{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m} subject to the relations
> ##{ e_i^n=q_i \mathbf{1}, \quad e_i e_j=\omega e_j e_i, \quad \forall j \lt i . }
>
> It is easy to see that #{C^{(n)}\left(q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_m\right)} is #{\mathbb{Z}_n}-graded where the degree of #{e_i} is #{\overline{1}}, the generator of #{\mathbb{Z}_n}. \citek{cheng2019new}

In \citek{cheng2019new}, note also that "Clifford algebras are weak [Hopf algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_algebra) in some symmetric tensor categories." while "generalized Clifford algebras are weak Hopf algebras in some suitable braided linear categories of graded vector spaces." as well as that "the Clifford process is a powerful technique to construct larger dimensional Clifford algebras from known ones."

TODO: add papers linking Hopf algebra and Clifford algebra together learned from the adjoint discord here.

Clifford algebras can be obtained by twisting of group algebras \citek{albuquerque2002clifford}, where twisted group algebras are studied in \citek{conlon1964twisted}, \citek{edwards1969twisted}, \citek{edwards1969twisted2}.

There exists isomorphisms between certain Clifford algebras and NDAs (Normed Division Algebras) over #{\mathbb{R}}.

Variants of Clifford algebras whose generators are idempotent or nilpotent can be considered. Zeon algebras ("nil-Clifford algebras") have proven to be useful in enumeration problems on graphs where certain configurations are forbidden, such as in the enumeration of matchings and self-avoiding walks. The idempotent property of the generators of idem-Clifford algebras can be used to avoid redundant information when enumerating certain graph and hypergraph structures. See \citek{ewing2022zeon}.

It's also closely related to universal enveloping algebra (see \citek{figueroa2010spin} and "The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra is the analogue of the usual group algebra of a group." from [group algebra on nlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group+algebra#RelationToUniversalEnvelopingAlgebra)).

Great discussions about the limitations and generalizations of Clifford algebras can be found in John C. Baez's \citek{baez2002octonions}. Particularly, note [Cayley-Dickson construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley-Dickson_construction), Bott periodicity, matrix algebra, triality, and #{\mathbb{R}} as a real commutative associative nicely normed âˆ—-algebra. Also see Anthony Lasenby's work on the embedding of octonions in the Clifford geometric algebra for space-time STA ( #{\mathop{\mathcal{C}\ell}(1, 3)} ) \citek{lasenby2024some}.

Note also Kingdon algebras: alternative Clifford-like algebras over vector spaces equipped with a symmetric bilinear form \citek{depies2024octonions}.
