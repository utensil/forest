\title{A Forester experiment}

\date{2024-04-27}

\p{I'm experimenting using [Forester](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml) for building [forests of evergreen notes](https://www.jonmsterling.com/tfmt-000V.xml) like [Notes on duploid theory](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-0047.xml).}

\p{I wish to use it to organize many definitions, proofs and discussions about the same mathematical concepts/topics. This is a spiritual successor to my "Many faces of Clifford algebras" writeup.}

\p{My hope is to find these notes easier to reuse and refer to in blogs, papers, blueprints etc.}
