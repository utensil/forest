\mdnote{Categorified Clifford Algebra}{
A categorical view of Clifford Algebra is discussed in \citek{figueroa2010spin}.

A Clifford Algebra can be [categorified](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/10/categorified_clifford_algebra.html): "An Clifford algebra over a vector space is defined to be the Koszul dual to an abelian fully weak Lie-algebra" where "Fully weak Lie-algebras are Koszul dual to differential graded Clifford algebras." See also [Higher Clifford Algebras](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/10/higher_clifford_algebras.html).
