Some key points:
- acceptance of uncertainty
- breakthrough of ideology
- unity of mathematical methods from different areas
- experimental phenomenon that can't be explained or current explanations is ugly or contain unexplained parameters: dark energy
- astronomy and condensed physics, the universe reveals itself by many layers, just like designed for interpretation
- limitations on high energy physics posed by society
- against perturbation theory, prefer structure
- geometric algebra, manifold, topology, holographic principle, gauge theory, knot theory, category theory...
- M-theory
