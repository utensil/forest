\refdef{Definition 1}{Complex Numbers}{

\p{
A complex number #{z} is a number of the form #{a + bi} where #{a} and #{b} are real numbers and #{i} is the imaginary unit defined by ##{i^2 = -1}
}

\li{Properties of complex numbers:}
  \ul{
  \li{Addition: #{(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i}}
  \li{Multiplication: #{(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i}}
  \li{The conjugate of #{a + bi} is #{a - bi}}

  \li{Euler's formula: ##{e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x}}

\refnote{Historical Note}{Discovery of Complex Numbers}{

\p{
The concept of complex numbers emerged from attempts to solve cubic equations in the 16th century.
\em{Gerolamo Cardano} was among the first to systematically use these "impossible" numbers.
}

{

\p{
The term "imaginary number" was coined by \em{Ren√© Descartes} in 1637, who used it as a derogatory term.
The modern notation #{i} was introduced by \em{Leonhard Euler} in 1777.
}
