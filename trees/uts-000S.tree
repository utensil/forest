\title{Forester experiment}

\p{I'm experimenting using Jon Sterling's [Forester](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml) for building [forests of evergreen notes](https://www.jonmsterling.com/tfmt-000V.xml) like his [Notes on duploid theory](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-0047.xml) ([source](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/public-trees)), CAIMEO's [The Rabbit Hole](https://caimeo.online/index.xml) ([source](https://github.com/CAIMEOX/caimeox.github.io)) or [Treborâ€™s forest](https://trebor-huang.github.io/forest/) ([source](https://github.com/trebor-huang/forest/)).}

\p{I wish to use it to organize many definitions, theorems and discussions about the same mathematical concepts/topics.}

\p{My hope is to find these notes easier to reuse and refer to in blogs, papers, blueprints etc. Preferably, I would like to be able to author them in Forester markup, LaTeX, and Typst freely.}

\p{If you are new to Forester, you may wish to check out [[math-000T]].}
