\p{I'm experimenting using [Jon Sterling](https://www.jonmsterling.com/)'s [Forester](https://www.forester-notes.org/) for building [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)-style [forests of evergreen notes](https://www.forester-notes.org/tfmt-0001/), like his [Notes on duploid theory](https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-0047/) ([source](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/public-trees)), CAIMEO's [The Rabbit Hole](https://caimeo.online/index.xml) ([source](https://github.com/CAIMEOX/caimeox.github.io)) or [Treborâ€™s forest](https://trebor-huang.github.io/forest/) ([source](https://github.com/trebor-huang/forest/)).}

\p{I wish to use it to organize many definitions, theorems and discussions about the same mathematical concepts/topics.}

\p{My hope is to find these notes easier to reuse and refer to in blogs, papers, [blueprints](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint) etc. Preferably, I would like to be able to author them in [Forester markup](https://www.forester-notes.org/jms-007N/), LaTeX, Markdown, Typst, and various [diagram tools](uts-0009), freely and in a reproducible manner (see [my post on this](uts-000X), and [relevant experiments](uts-0010)).}
