\refdeft{sphere tracing}{sec. 2.2, eq. 11}{hart1996sphere}{
\p{The \newvocab{sphere tracing} algorithm is to march a ray by an adaptive safe step size, which is the absolute value of the \vocab{signed distance bound} calculated by #{f/\lambda} from \ref{ag-000T}, the rest is the same as \vocabk{ray marching (na√Øve)}{ag-001B}.
}

\p{Formally, the root found by \vocab{sphere tracing} is the limit point of the sequence defined by the recurrence equation

##{t_{i+1} = t_i + \frac{|f(t_i)|}{\lambda} }

where #{t_0 = 0} and usually #{\lambda = 1}.
