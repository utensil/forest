\refdeft{sphere tracing}{sec. 2.3, eq. 12}{hart1996sphere}{
\p{The \newvocab{sphere tracing} algorithm is to march a ray by an adaptive safe step size, which is the absolute value of the \vocab{signed distance bound} calculated by #{F/\lambda} per \ref{ag-000T}, the rest is the same as \vocabk{ray marching (na√Øve)}{ag-001B}.
}

\p{Formally, the root found by \vocab{sphere tracing} is the limit point of the sequence defined by the recurrence equation

##{t_{i+1} = t_i + \frac{|F(t_i)|}{\lambda} = t_i + \frac{f(\point{r}(t_i))}{\lambda} }

where #{F} is the \vocabk{ray intersection}{ag-000W}, and #{f} is the SDF.
}

\p{Usually #{\lambda = 1}, and #{F(t_i)} stays positive until the stopping condition #{F(t_i) < \epsilon} is met, so the above can be simplified to

##{t_{i+1} = t_i + F(t_i) = t_i + f(\point{r}(t_i)) }
}
