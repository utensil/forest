\refcardt{lemma}{uniqueness of adjoints}{5.8}{kostecki2011introduction}{

\p{A left or right adjoint, if it exists, is unique up to natural isomorphism.}

\proof{For the left adjoint, from [the university of #{\eta}](tt-001W) it follows that there exists a unique, up to isomorphism, isomorphism between different left adjoints. It remains to show naturality of this isomorphim, which is left as an exercise. The proof for right adjoint follows by duality.
