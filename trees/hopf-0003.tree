Of course, this structure is much weaker as e.g. a normed space or an inner product space. It does not allow to introduce the concept of length, distance or angle. Therefore it is clear that a geometry based on this structure cannot be metric. However, the bracket can be addressed as a volume form. Volume measurements are used e.g. in the analysis of chaotic systems and strange attractors.
