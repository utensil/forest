\texdef{Spin group}{liu2016lie}{
The space of quadratic vectors in \(\mathrm{Cl}\) is the Lie algebra of \(\mathrm{SO}(n)\). The corresponding Lie group, called the Spin group \(\operatorname{Spin}(Q)\), is the set of invertible elements \(x \in \mathrm{Cl}\) that preserve \(V\) under \(v \mapsto x v x^{-1}\). Clearly this map is in \(\mathrm{SO}(V, Q)\) since it preserves the quadratic form \(Q\), and is a two-fold cover with kernel \(\pm 1\).
