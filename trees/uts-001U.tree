\mdnote{Spin groups}{
The PR to Mathlib [#9111](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9111) about Spin groups is ready to merge, but there are 2 open questions:

- what more lemmas about Spin groups are interesting to mathematians?
- what more should be formalized to formalize Versors and whatâ€™s in Section "The contents of a geometric algebra" in \citek{chisolm2012geometric} , e.g. r-blades, r-vectors?

For the former, I should take a closer look at \citek{figueroa2010spin} and maybe \citek{suarez2019expository}, \citek{reynoso2023probing}.

For the latter, see the [Z-filteration in lean-ga](https://github.com/pygae/lean-ga/blob/master/src/geometric_algebra/from_mathlib/versors.lean) and [the prototype](https://github.com/eric-wieser/lftcm2023-clifford_algebra/).

I also wish to include some latest results presented in \citek{ruhe2023clifford}, with supplements from \citek{brehmer2023geometric} (lately there is a new paper applying this in HEP \citek{spinner2024lorentz}, in the same spirit, I should also read \citek{berzins2024geometry} and possibly \citek{raissi2019physics}), in which some of the results are proven in \citek{roelfs2023graded}.

See also discussions in the [lean-ga blueprint](https://utensil.github.io/lean-ga/blueprint/sect0007.html).

I've started a Forester experiment about the definitions of Spin groups [here](https://utensil.github.io/forest/spin-0001.xml). I also need to check citations of [On some Lie groups in degenerate Clifford geometric algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06842).
