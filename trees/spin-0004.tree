\p{A versor refers to a Clifford monomial composed of invertible vectors. It is called a rotor, or spinor, if the number of vectors is even. It is called a unit versor if its magnitude is 1.}

\p{All versors in #{\mathcal{C L}\left(\mathcal{V}^n\right)} form a group under the geometric product, called the versor group, also known as the Clifford group, or Lipschitz group. All rotors form a subgroup, called the rotor group. All unit versors form a subgroup, called the pin group, and all unit rotors form a subgroup, called the spin group, denoted by #{\operatorname{Spin}\left(\mathcal{V}^n\right)}.}
