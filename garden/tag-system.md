title: Tag system
tag: meta

In this note, I would like write down my thoughts on designing my tag system.

This is initially inspired that lobste.rs has [a tag system for filtering](https://lobste.rs/filters), and Simon Willisonâ€™s Weblog has [a rich tag system](https://simonwillison.net/tags/).

For now, I just have the following examples:

- #post
- #im
- #selfhost
